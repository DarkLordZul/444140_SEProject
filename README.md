Description
-----------
The purpose of this project is twofold
1 - to explore and contrast the speeds at which 3 sorting algorithms can preform a sorting task
2 - to use GDBM and text fileIO

Python Versions
--------------
At this point in time both FileIO and Sorts packages have been tested under Python 3.4
While it is possible they make work with earlier versions, full support can only be guaranteed under python 3.4
If you have an older version or no current version of python visit www.python.org or contact your network administrator to obtain a new version

Additional Packages
--------------
Numpy 1.8 will be required for the implementation of quickSort when using the Sorts package

Installation
------------
Unzip Project.zip and move the desired .py file to your root directory or any desired location
Open a command line terminal from your chosen location or change the directory of your terminal to point at this location
run the command: python \<some package>.py
OR
Whole project is availbe on github from:

Testing
-------
The Sorts program has its own testing unit build in (Testing.py) this is carried out using python's native unittesting framework
as FileIO was mainly a demonstration it does not as yet have its own testing unit and eimply runs when executed: \IOManager.py
