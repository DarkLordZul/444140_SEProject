Description
-----------
The purpose of this project is to perform one of four possible arithmetic calculations on two numerical inputs
These numerical inputs, as well as the desired arithmetic function, are provided by the user
The four arithmetic functions are as follows:
	m - The minimum of A and B - min(A, B)
	+ - The sum of A and B - sum(A, B)
	\ - The quotient A by B - quotient(A, B)
	% - The remainder after dividing A by B - remainder(A, B)

Python Versions
--------------
At this point in time both FileIO and Sorts packages have been tested under Python 3.4
While it is possible they make work with earlier versions, full support can only be guaranteed under python 3.4
If you have an older version or no current version of python visit www.python.org or contact your network administrator to obtain a new version

Installation
------------
Unzip SciCalc.zip and move the Calc.py file to your root directory or any desired location
Open a command line terminal from your chosen location or change the directory of your terminal to point at this location
run the command: python \Calc.py
type in your first, second number when prompted
type in your operator when prompted
observe the result printed directly to the terminal

OR:
From the Calcu-v1 subfolder and run python setup.py install from a command line terminal (which points to the same file directory which you have extracted to)
run the command: python Calcu
type in your first, second number when prompted
type in your operator when prompted
observe the result printed directly to the terminal

Testing
-------
Extensive testing has been carried out to ensure this program works as accurately as possible
Testing was carried out manually - the details of which are included in the documentation under Section 7
